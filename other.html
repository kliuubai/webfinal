    In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, the main themes of survival, nature, the relativity of reality, and faith all intersect in the pivotal form of Richard Parker—but not only does this Bengal tiger represent Pi’s descent into animalistic behavior and the epitome of natural power, he is a symbol standing in for God himself. This essay will explore the divine allegory that is Richard Parker.<br>
    <br>Pi’s relationship to Richard Parker perfectly mirrors a human’s relationship to the divine. This is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by Pi’s simultaneous fear and love for Richard Parker. Pi spends a good hundred pages in utter dread and fear of the tiger, describing his terror as if his “lungs have flown away like a bird and [his] guts have slithered away like a snake” (Martel 161). When mortals are confronted with a higher being, this is their exact emotion: helplessness and terror in the face of something infinitely more powerful. Accompanying this terror, however, is also awe and reverence. Indeed, when Pi sees Richard Parker getting ready to attack him, he is almost appreciative. Pi describes the tiger’s pre-strike pose as “a display of mighty art” (151), having a presence that “was overwhelming, yet equally evident was the lithesome grace of it” (151). Even with his life on the line, Pi still manages to admire Richard Parker’s strength. Just like how the gods (or God) are at the top of the chain of existence, a tiger’s strength secures its spot at the top of the food chain—and when Pi bears witness to such raw power, he feels both exalted and paralyzed. Eventually, these mixed feelings dive head-first into complete attachment and love, with Pi gushing to RP that “[he] loves [him]” (236) and that “[he] would die of hopelessness” (236) without him. Although this speech may be a product of Pi going mad after so long at sea, it still manages to reflect how deeply Pi has come to rely on Richard Parker’s presence. In a nutshell, we’ve witnessed Pi’s ascent into faith: he starts afraid, seeing the divine as a threat, wanting to kill it off—but in the end, he realizes how he never could’ve survived without it. There is one place, however, where this allegory doesn’t seem to match up: Pi’s taming of Richard Parker.<br>
    <br>On the surface, it seems contradictory for Martel to showcase God in his story and also render Him weak at the hands of a mere human—but in reality, this apparent contradiction enhances the divine allegory. After Pi steps into the circus ring, so to speak, it seems like Pi is the one with power over Richard Parker, not the other way around. For example, when Pi has staring contests with a newly tamed Richard Parker, “[the tiger] never stare[s] back; his gaze always float[s] in mid-air” (211). While the divine does not bow down to humans, it seems clear here that Richard Parker is bowing down to Pi. However—what Martel may actually be doing is showing the ways humans attempt to bend God to their will. To some extent, even the fundamental act of prayer is an attempt to get God to do a favor for the believer; the believer gives their faith and God is thought to give back. The idea of this give-and-receive relationship is an attempt on the believer’s part to control the divine and use God as the method of obtaining what they want. Pi does this exact thing by trying to tame and manipulate Richard Parker. However, at the end of the book, after Pi thinks that he has obtained total control over Richard Parker, the tiger proves to be ultimately uncontrollable. As their journey comes to an end, Pi “[is] certain [Richard Parker] would turn [his] way” (284), that “he would look at [Pi]” (284), that “in some such way, he would conclude [their] relationship” (284), but “he [does] no such thing” (284). Although this ending does not symbolize the death of God in Pi, as Pi clearly remains a believer, what it does symbolize is Pi’s rightful realization that Richard Parker/God will never be his to control.<br>
    <br>After this scene of Richard Parker leaving Pi, Martel presents the multilayered interview, in which Pi even tells the readers explicitly that the animals in his story are symbolic for God. When Pi asks his skeptical interviewers which story they preferred—the one with or without the animals—they concede that the hardly believable, yet far less gruesome animal story is the better one. Pi replies, “And so it goes with God” (317). Here, Martel has clearly and explicitly drawn a parallel between the animals in his story and the concept of God. Although the divine may falter in the face of rationality, logic, or science, Pi believes in it because it makes the Universe a better place to exist. And although the idea of surviving several months with a Bengal tiger may falter in the face of the same rationality, logic, or science, Pi believes in it because it makes his own story far more bearable. He is teaching us not to “lack imagination and miss the better story” (64). He is teaching us, as his uncle promises he would, to believe in Richard Parker and therefore to believe in God. This is the clearest indicator that Richard Parker is symbolic for the divine.<br>
    <br>In this same interview, Martel communicates another one of the main themes of the book: the relativity of reality, that ability to choose what the truth is. Belief in God and Richard Parker is Pi’s truth, belief in nonbelief is the truth of atheists and Pi’s interviewers, and what the reader believes is up to the reader to choose. Richard Parker can be interpreted as a literal Bengal tiger and nothing beyond that, as well as Pi’s stand-in for himself, as well as God Himself, because all of these things are Real and True in their own way. In the end, no essay can convince a reader what ultimate truth underlies Life of Pi, because there is none. In the end, everything is true: Richard Parker is Pi is God.
