    <h2>Books I Like</h2>

    <p style="margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 30px;">I find reading really enjoyable. When I pick up a book, I get to explore new ideas, meet fascinating characters, and go on epic adventures, from the comfort of my own home. It's a great way to relax and unwind after a hectic day. Whether I'm in the mood for something that will force me to reevaluate everything I've ever learned or something that's a warm, cozy escape from reality, reading never fails to entertain and inspire me. The above books are some that I've really enjoyed these past couple months.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 175px;">Music I Like</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><img src="images/arlo.jpg" style="height: 230px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></li>
        <li><img src="images/record.jpg" style="height: 230px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></li>
        <li><img src="images/jubilee.webp" style="height: 230px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></li>
        <li><img src="images/alvvays.jpg" style="height: 230px;"></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px;">Music is similar to reading in that it can be a perfect escape from reality. I love music that feels raw and real, like something personal and revealing that the artist has created. It helps me understand myself better and it’s really good at creating an atmosphere, whether I’m studying, on the car, or resting after school. Above are four albums that I love to listen to (Collapsed in Sunbeams by Arlo Parks, The Record by Boygenius, Jubilee by Japanese Breakfast, and Antisocialites by Alvvays).</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Movies I Like</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><img src="images/dune.webp" style="height: 270px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></li>
        <li><img src="images/howls.jpg" style="height: 270px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px;margin-bottom: 200px;">To be honest, I’ve never been all too interested in movies, but the select few that I do like are pretty magical to me. I think a movie gets to use the combination of visual, sound, and story to create a synthesized experience that appeals to multiple senses, which is why they can be so powerful. The two movies I’ve chosen, I think, are really good at utilizing beautiful and unique cinematography, scores, and plotlines.</p>
