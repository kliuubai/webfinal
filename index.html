    <p id="home-desc">My family comes from Shanghai, China, by my parents immigrated here some 20 years ago to attend university, where they both got degrees in computer science. Originally they lived around the East Coast but eventually ended up on the West, in the hub of technology. Although it rains every five minutes and summers are always too short, I love the West Coast because it’s ripe with culture and nature.<br>
    <br>I like to read and write, and I enjoy drawing and painting when I can—though, if I’m being honest, going on the Internet is probably how most of my time gets spent. In terms of interests, I’m curious about history, literature, and languages. In the future I hope to become a professor or some other kind of expert in one of those fields. I especially enjoy learning about Chinese history because it allows me to reconnect with my roots. I also love listening to music, because it has the same immersive effect as reading. However, this is not to say that I’m exclusively interested in the arts or humanities. Technology and sciences are really cool as well! Since my parents have lots of experience in those fields, I like learning more about how the physical and digital worlds work and intersect.<br>
    <br>At school, I enjoy eating lunch, going to classes that align with my existing interests or classes that create new ones, and spending time with my friends. I have a small group of friends, which I think allows us to be more tight-knit. I consider myself a somewhat-introvert (ambivert?) that loves spending time with people but who also needs alone time to recharge.
